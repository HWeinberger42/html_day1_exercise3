                With your feet on the air and your head on the ground <br>
                Try this trick and spin it, (Yeah) yeah <br>
                Your head will collapse, if there's nothing in it <br>

                I was swimmin' in the Caribbean <br>
                Animals were hidin' behind the rock <br>
                Except the little fish <br>
                Bump into me, swear he's tryin' a talk to me, say wait, wait <br>

                Black Francis says that “Where Is My Mind?” <br>
                was written during the time he was attending <br>
                the University of Massachusetts Amherst, <br>
                and was inspired by the experience of having <br>
                a small fish chase him while he was snorkeling in the Caribbean.
