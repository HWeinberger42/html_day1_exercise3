        <div>
            With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
            Try this trick and spin it, (Yeah) yeah
            Your head will collapse, if there's nothing in it
            And you'll ask yourself

            Where is my mind?
            Where is my mind?
            Where is my mind?
            (Where is my mind? Where is my mind?)
            (Where is my mind?)
            Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
        </div>

        <div>
            I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
            Animals were hidin' behind the rock
            Except the little fish
            Bump into me, swear he's tryin' a talk to me, say wait, wait
        </div>
        <div>
            Where is my mind?
            Where is my mind?
            Where is my mind?
            (Where is my mind? Where is…)
            Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
